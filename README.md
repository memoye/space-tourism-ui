## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (I tried ðŸ˜‘)
- CSS
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

### What I learned

I learned to configure my routes with objects which feels much more intuitive to me than the usual JSX way I was used to.

This project is a way of introducing myself to the new [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). The [new version](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) comes with a lot of features I'm excited to get familiar with and this project was just me sticking a foot int the pond. The nested routes were a bit tricky, but although it's not the best way I could have done it, I'm glad I was able to find a way to handle them.

Making it responsive took a bit of a work-around too, but I did it ðŸ˜…

Overall, I enjoyed working on this. I like what I came up with, although I'm not satisfied. Therefore I'm open to any suggestions or contributions you may have as regards any part of it.

### Continued development

Get better.
